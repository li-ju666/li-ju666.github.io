### About me
I am a first-year Ph.D candidate in Scientific Computing at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en), 
supervised by Associate Professor [Andreas Hellander](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/andreash). 
Prior to joining Andrea's group, I earned MS.c degrees in Computational Science at Uppsala
University, MS.c in Chemometrics at 
[University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC),
and BS.c in Chemistry at USTC. 

### Research Interests
I am currently working on federated machine learning of both theoretical and applied aspects. 
In particular, I am interested in problems arising in large-scale applications of federated learning. 

### News
 - 10/06/22: We released [*Blades*](https://github.com/bladesteam/blades), 
a simulator for Byzantine-robust federated learning with attacks and defenses, on GitHub. 
 - 21/12/21: Our paper
["Proactive autoscaling for edge computing systems with kubernetes"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3492323.3495588)
got accepted in [UCC '21](https://ucc-conference.org/). 
 - 01/09/21: I started my Ph.D study at [TDB](https://www.it.uu.se/research/scientific_computing),
Uppsala University, co-supervised by Andreas Hellander
and Salman Toor.
