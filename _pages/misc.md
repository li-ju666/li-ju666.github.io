## Music Taste
I am a dedicated metal head. I am particularly into
- [black metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_metal) music of various sub / fusion genres (orthodox black metal, raw black metal, blackened death metal, Ross Bay Cult, Les Légions Noires, you name it. )
- [visual kei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_kei) music (Dir En Grey, the GazettE, Malice Mizer, Moi Dix Mois, ナイトメア, etc. )

## Video Games
I am very into videos games produced by [宮崎英高](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AE%AE%E5%B4%8E%E8%8B%B1%E9%AB%98), especially [Dark Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls_(video_game)) and [Dark Souls III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls_III). Though [Elden Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring) is fun anyway, I personally do not flavour the weapon skill system introduced. Instead, I enjoy defeating bosses with basic attacks and dodge rolls after dozens of attempts. 

[League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) is another video game I spent a significant amount of time on (Platium I in Season 5 and 6). BUT, it is only fun when playing with friends. (PS: Its ELO system s*cks)

Other video games I like: Monster Hunter: World, Monster Hunter: Iceborne, World of Warcraft, It Takes Two.
