### About me
I am a fourth-year Ph.D candidate in Scientific Computing at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en), 
supervised by Associate Professor [Andreas Hellander](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/andreash). 
Prior to starting my Ph.D study, I earned MS.c in Computational Science at Uppsala
University, MS.c in Chemometrics at 
[University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC),
and BS.c in Chemistry at USTC. 

### Research Interests
I am currently working on learning from distributed heterogeneous data.
Particularly, I am interested in the data heterogeneity problems in federated learning and uncertainty quantification for multi-modal language models.
