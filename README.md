# Li Ju's Academic Website

This is the source code for my academic website, hosted on GitHub Pages.
It is based on a fork of [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

## Local Development
To run this site locally:

1. Install Ruby and Bundler.
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the server at `http://localhost:4000`.
