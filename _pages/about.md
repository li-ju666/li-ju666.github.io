### About me
I am a second-year Ph.D candidate in Scientific Computing at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en), 
supervised by Associate Professor [Andreas Hellander](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/andreash). 
Prior to starting my Ph.D study, I earned MS.c in Computational Science at Uppsala
University, MS.c in Chemometrics at 
[University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC),
and BS.c in Chemistry at USTC. 

### Research Interests
I am currently working on federated machine learning of both theoretical and applied aspects. 
In particular, I am interested in problems arising in large-scale applications of federated learning. 

### News
 - 10/22: I had a poster presentation at the [Swedish e-Science Academy](https://essenceofescience.se/programme-the-swedish-e-science-academy-on-5-6-october/)
   about accelerating fair federated learning in Ume√•, Sweden. 
 - 06/22: We released [*Blades*](https://github.com/bladesteam/blades), 
a simulator for Byzantine-robust federated learning with attacks and defenses. 
 - 12/21: Our paper
["Proactive autoscaling for edge computing systems with kubernetes"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3492323.3495588)
got accepted in [UCC '21](https://ucc-conference.org/). 
 - 09/21: I started my Ph.D study at [TDB](https://www.it.uu.se/research/scientific_computing),
Uppsala University, co-supervised by Andreas Hellander
and Salman Toor.
